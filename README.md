# Scout Vision

Real-time computer vision for embedded Rust on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W - developed for the Scout Rust Rover project. This project implements YOLOv8 object detection using custom OpenCV bindings and ONNX Runtime, achieving deterministic performance on severely resource-constrained hardware.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv8 Integration**: ONNX Runtime with Rust bindings
- **OpenCV for Rust**: For better edge detection
- **Live Web Interface**: Real-time video streaming and telemetry at 5-10 FPS
- **Deterministic Real-time Performance**: 45-50ms consistent inference time (no GC pauses)
- **Minimal Memory Footprint**: 45-55MB total RAM usage including model
- **Safety-Critical Design**: Compile-time guarantees for obstacle avoidance

### If needed: 
- **[Pre-Compiled Release Binary](https://github.com/CartesianXR7/scout-vision/blob/master/target/release/rover)**: Pre-compiled binary for Pi Zero 2W included to avoid slow / difficult compilation
- **[Custom OpenCV Bindings](https://github.com/CartesianXR7/scout-vision/tree/master/opencv-embedded)**: Hybrid FFI approach to avoid resource-constrained compilation
